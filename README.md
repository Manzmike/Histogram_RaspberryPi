# TTL Board Description Handler

This project provides a C++ class (`TTL_board`) for managing and manipulating the description of a TTL board. The program is designed for the EGRE 347 course, Spring 2022, and includes functionalities such as setting and getting the board's attributes, as well as input/output operations with files.

## Features

- Initialize a TTL board with default or specified attributes.
- Set and get board attributes:
  - Part number
  - Part name
  - Description
  - Family
  - Package
  - VCC levels
  - VIH and VIL levels
- Load a TTL board's attributes from an input file.
- Unload (or write) a TTL board's attributes to an output file.
- Display the board's details in a standardized format.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Standard C++ libraries (iostream, string, fstream, iomanip)

## Compilation

To compile the project, make sure you have the required `SSI.h` header file. The compilation might look like:

```bash
g++ -o program_name your_cpp_file_name.cpp
```

## Usage

After creating an object of the `TTL_board` class, you can:

1. Set various attributes using the provided setter methods.
2. Get any attributes using the provided getter methods.
3. Load the board's data from an input file using the `load()` method.
4. Write the board's data to an output file using the `unload()` method.
5. Display the board's details using the `print()` method.

## Sample Methods

- `Set_Number`: Set the part number of the board.
- `Get_Number`: Retrieve the part number of the board.
- `load`: Load board details from an input file.
- `unload`: Write board details to an output file.

## Notes

Make sure you understand the format and structure of the input file if you are using the `load()` method. The sequence and format of data in the input file should match the expected structure in the `load()` method.
